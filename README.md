# Elemental VR Game (WIP)

Independently developed a VR game in Unity Game Engine for Oculus Quest 2. Character controls a wand to attack elemental enemies and cast elemental spells
with varying levels of damage against enemies of certain elemental types e.g. water attacks are more effective against fire enemies) by drawing
hand motions with VR controllers, and placing correct numbers of collectable items into portals to trigger a boss-level fight. Work in progress 
for spell casting functionality by capturing drawn hand motions and boss combat mechanics.
